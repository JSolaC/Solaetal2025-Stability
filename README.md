# Sola et al. 2025 — Counteracting Cascades Challenge the Heterogeneity–Stability Relationship

This repository contains the data and R code used for the study:
Sola, J., Fairchild, T.P., Perkins, M.J., Bull, J.C., & Griffin, J.N. (2025). Counteracting cascades challenge the heterogeneity–stability relationship.

The study presents a three-year field experiment conducted on a rocky shore to test the ecological assumption that spatial heterogeneity enhances community temporal stability. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we found no net effect of heterogeneity on stability, due to counteracting cascades involving species richness, population dynamics, and dominant species suppression. This repository enables full reproducibility of the analyses, figures, and models presented in the paper.
